- **Negative balance (-300)** = Driver owes money to company
- **Positive balance (+200)** = Company owes money to driver
- **Zero balance (0)** = Account is balanced

### Money Flow Direction
- **Company ‚Üí Driver**: Company gives advance/payment to driver
- **Driver ‚Üí Company**: Driver returns money/pays debt to company

## üí∞ Complete Flow Examples

### üìã Example 1: Driver Owes Company Money

#### Initial State
```
Company gives ‚Çπ300 advance to driver
Driver wallet: -300 (driver owes ‚Çπ300)
```

#### Trip Details
```
Driver expenses: ‚Çπ1000 (fuel, food, etc.)
Driver receiving: ‚Çπ500 (from client)
```

#### Settlement Calculation
```
Trip settlement = Receiving - Expenses
Trip settlement = 500 - 1000 = -500

Final wallet = Current wallet + Trip settlement  
Final wallet = (-300) + (-500) = -800

Result: Driver owes ‚Çπ800 to company
```

#### Physical Settlement (In Office)
```
1. Driver comes to company office
2. Admin checks: "Driver owes ‚Çπ800"
3. Driver gives ‚Çπ800 cash to company
4. Admin processes settlement
5. Driver wallet becomes ‚Çπ0 (balanced)
