## 🔄 Settlement Process Flow

1. **Booking Completion** → Driver completes booking (status = 1)
2. **Settlement Preview** → Admin previews settlement calculation
3. **Settlement Processing** → Admin processes settlement with wallet adjustment
4. **Transaction Creation** → System creates transaction record
5. **Notification** → Driver can view settlement details
6. **Optional Reversal** → Admin can reverse if needed

---

## 💰 Settlement Calculation Logic

```javascript
// Expense Total
expenseTotal = billingItemsSum + allowancesSum

// Receiving Total  
receivingTotal = billingItemsSum + allowancesSum + receivedFromCompany + receivedFromClient

// Settlement Amount
settlementAmount = expenseTotal - receivingTotal + adminAdjustments

// Wallet Action
if (settlementAmount > 0) {
  // Driver owes money → Debit from wallet
} else if (settlementAmount < 0) {
  // Company owes driver → Credit to wallet
} else {
  // Balanced → No action
}
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### Enhanced Settlement Schema
```javascript
settlement: {
  isSettled: Boolean,
  settlementAmount: Number,
  calculatedAmount: Number,
  adminAdjustments: Number,
  notes: String,
  settledAt: Date,
  settledBy: ObjectId, // Admin who processed
  settledByRole: String, // 'admin' or 'subadmin'
  status: String, // 'pending', 'completed', 'reversed'
  transactionId: ObjectId, // Reference to wallet transaction
  reversedAt: Date,
  reversedBy: ObjectId,
  reversalReason: String
}
```
